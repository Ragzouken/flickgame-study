# candle's flickgame study
i'm candle and this is my attempt at a "study" of stephen lavelle's [flickgame][1] tool

the idea is to clone flickgame to practice and refine my own toolmaking techniques. you can [read more about this on my website][2]

## format
a flickgame is a set of picture scenes. in each scene certain colors are clickable and lead to other scenes

this is a tool for painting picture scenes and specifying links between them

## hotkeys
 * __ctrl+z__: undo
 * __ctrl+y__: redo
 * __ctrl+c__: copy scene
 * __ctrl+v__: paste scene
 * __qwer__: change tool
 * __asdf__: change brush
 * __alt+click__: pick color
