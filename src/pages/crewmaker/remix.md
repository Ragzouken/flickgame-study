# remix
you are remixing a flickguy in an editor that is cloned from the original and may be out of date

if you're intending to make your own flickguy consider clicking the "update" button to reopen your data in the latest online version of this editor--this will help reduce the proliferaton of bugs

additionally the save feature is disabled in remixes to avoid a user's browser saves being scattered over many sites

if you are modding the flickguy editor itself, or simply wish to enable the features hidden in remixes, you can edit the html to reset the "data-remix-generation" to "0" and change the "data-editor-live" to point to your modded version (this is what the "update" button uses)
