# flickguy
i'm candle and this is my take on a low-effort picrew inspired by stephen lavelle's [flickgame][0] tool

i made this tool to help iron out a web tool template i'm working on, [read more about it on my website][2]

## format
a flickguy is a tool for making little guys by compositing layers. each layer
has a selection of image options and those images can optionally be palette
swapped for color variations

this is a tool or creating flickguys by painting 8 image options for 8 layers. the exported flickguy also allows the user to "remix" it to either make bespoke
adjustments to their guy or make a whole new derivative flickguy to let others use
